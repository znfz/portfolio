This repository is a curated set of notebooks created that contains neural networks built using PyTorch and goes through the logic of the architecture of the model step by step.

- Linear_Regression.ipynb
Notebook contains a simple linear regression model for synthetic data created for specifically for this purpose. While it is overkill to use a neural network for linear regression, this would be the best introduction to understand how neural networks operate on a granular level before moving onto more complex objectives.

- Binary_Classification.ipynb
The make_moons dataset from scikit_learn contains datapoints that belong to one of two circles and this factor has been used as the basis to use a neural network to detect if a datapoint will belong to which circle.

- Multiclass_Classification.ipynb
Synthetic data was generated that belongs to one of five classes. A neural network was developed that can predict what class a future datapoint will belong to.

- CNN.ipynb
The FashionMNIST dataset contains 70000 gray images that fall into 10 clothing categories. A convolutional neural network was developed that predicts what a future image would be.
